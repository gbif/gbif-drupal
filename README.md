GBIF Drupal
===========

This was part of the GBIF.org website until its replacement in August 2017.  The replacement is available under [portal16](https://github.com/gbif/portal16).

The GBIF.org Drupal site

This repository only hosts contributed and customised modules/themes that are used in GBIF Portal. To make a functioning site for development, you'll need to download Drupal core from drupal.org. We are on Drupal 7 at the moment.
