This module provides various extenstions and (possible) improvements to the Countries modules.

It has several dependencies in addition to the obvious Countries module:
- Entity (entity)
- Libraries

The GeoNames PEAR library is also necessary for pin fetching/updating.
To install it do the following:

1. Download http://download.pear.php.net/package/Services_GeoNames-1.0.1.tgz into this directory.
2. Extract the file.  This will create a "Services_GeoNames-1.0.1" directory. Rename it to 'geonames'.
3. Don't worry, be happy.  You're done.
