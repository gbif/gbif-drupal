      <h3>Why this form?</h3>
      <p>To start the process of publishing data through GBIF, we ask new prospective publishers to complete this online questionnaire.</p>
      <p>The process seeks to confirm the quality, interoperability and discoverability of data published through GBIF and to ensure that publishers receive proper credit and attribution. Learn more about <a href="/publishing-data/benefits">benefits</a>, <a href="/publishing-data/guidelines">guidelines</a>, and <a href="/publishing-data/resources">resources</a> elsewhere in <a href="/publishing-data/summary">this section</a>.</p>
      <p>Before GBIF indexes new datasets, a data-holding organization or institution must receive endorsement as a data publisher from a <a href="/participation/participant-list">GBIF Participant node</a> or the <a href="/governance/standingcommittees#nodes">Participant Node Managers Committee</a>.</p>
      <p>The endorsement procedure aims to ensure that:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Published data are relevant to GBIF’s scope and objectives</li>
        <li>Data hosting arrangements are stable and persistent</li>
        <li>Data publishing and use are supported by strong national, regional and thematic engagement</li>
        <li>Data are as open and available for sharing and reuse as possible</li>
        <li>Data publishers can respond to feedback and improve data quality</li>
      </ol>
      <p>To help endorsing node make informed decisions, we ask new prospective data publishers to complete this online questionnaire.</p>
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: at present, GBIF and its Participants only publish data from organizations — that is, institutions, networks and societies — rather than individuals. Individuals wishing to publish data should work through their affiliated organizations to seek endorsement as a publisher.</p>
